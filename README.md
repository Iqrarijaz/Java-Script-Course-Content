# Arrays
## Splice

splice() is another handy method that allows you to add and remove elements from anywhere within an array.

While push() and pop() limit you to adding and removing elements from the end of an array, splice() lets you specify the index location to add new elements, as well as the number of elements you'd like to delete (if any).

var donuts = ["glazed", "chocolate frosted", "Boston creme", "glazed cruller"];
donuts.splice(1, 1, "chocolate cruller", "creme de leche"); 


# Directions:

Use a nested for loop to take the numbers array below and replace all of the values that are divisible by 2 (even numbers) with the string "even" and all other numbers with the string "odd".
/*
 * Programming Quiz: Nested Numbers (6-10)
 * QUIZ REQUIREMENTS
 *   - The `numbers` variable is an array of arrays.
 *   - Use a nested `for` loop to cycle through `numbers`.
 *   - Convert each even number to the string "even"
 *   - Convert each odd number to the string "odd"
